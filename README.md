### ðŸ‘‹ Hey!

I'm a senior software engineering living in the Washington, DC area. My main interests include open-source software, 3D printing, 3D scanning, CAD and mechanical design, and embedded development. My current professional work deals mostly with cyber security, but in the past I worked in writing software for 3D scanners, medical robotics, 3D visualizers (OpenGL/DirectX), and computer-aided machining. 

### My Primary Skills

I've been working with C/C++ for over 12 years with myriad libraries and technologies, and have extensive additional professional experience in CUDA/OpenCL, OpenGL/GLSL, Python, Java, C#, embedded C, and other miscellaneous scripting languages (e.g., Zeek/Bro). 

### What I'm Working On These Days

Professionaly I work in network security, managing and developing scaled deep analysis frameworks for the financial sector.

In my free time I've been working on exploring LLMs/AI, improving my custom 3D printer (firmware and hardware), contributing to a number of FOSS projects (e.g., FreeCAD), and designing various objects in CAD (FreeCAD or Rhino3D).
